!!IF the bot turns you turn. If it doesn’t you don’t. 
For that I’d say we detect the intersection,
We need to stop whether or not we are turning.
If we could detect the leader before 
and we aren’t detecting the leader anymore, then we turn - turn right for right lane following.

If we weren’t tailing a bot to begin with, we decide. Could decide randomly but I prefer to just drive straight


○ Blink the appropriate rear LED to signal left or right turns at the intersection 
What’s the rear LED? How do we change it? Is this just another service? What’s the appropriate signal?

How do we tell when our leader is turning? Do the detections return pose estimates?
